# my-hecto
Made a personal text editor in rust that is based of [hecto](https://www.flenker.blog/) and added more functionalities for personal use. Functionalities added include:

- [ ] Support more filetypes
- [x] Line numbers: Display the line number to the left of each line of the file.
- [x] Allow alternatives. For instance, in many languages, characters are not highlighted separately, but instead, strings can be delimited with single or  double quotes.
- [ ] Copy and paste: Give the user a way to select text, and then copy the selected text when they press Ctrl-C, and let them paste the copied text when they press Ctrl-V.
